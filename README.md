                App Idea: TimeAccurateBanking (TAB)

Description:
    TimeAccurateBanking also known as TAB would address the issue of making payments and the payment says pending so the amount is not removed from your account until it is complete. This would require user to do the math themselves and this would be even harder when there are multiple purchases. The app will also calculate how your balance will look at the end of the month for people to reference. Inspired by the app Rocket Money - a finance tracker.
    
Key features:
    • Does the calculations for "pending" purchases to the account
            • will show the balance as if the pending purchases have went through, shows before and after "pending" prices & what the cost difference was (including dates of when everything would be processed by)
            
    • Calculates utlines monthly/yearly expected balance after all the subscriptions and bills
            • Allows for planning and listiing of all the fees as well as the date the card will be charged
            
    • Notifications for specific card transactions such as when card is below a certain amount or when money is taken out
    
    • Provides Financial challenges with tips for saving, investing or working on improving credit score 
            • Similar to an habit tracker but with a 10-20-30 day challenge to not spend on uber eats or buying online
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
 
 I believe the instructions and assigment was easy to follow but the reason for why it took me so long was because of the downloads and the buffer/ loading time when building the simulation to look at a feature.
